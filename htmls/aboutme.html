        My name is Iratni DJillali Mohamed Anouar, yes i know quite a long name,
        i was born in Tizi-Ouzou on the 11th of august year 2002. My childhood
        was kind of wierd since at that time i was way more productive than what
        i am right now, i was studying religion, practicing swimming, and
        learning judo, and somehow felt like i had time to spare. sadly i don't
        feel the same way anymore even though i'm less productive.
